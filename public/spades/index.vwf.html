 I'm trying to test a one on one conference running a localhost server.  I'm been seeing the same issue.  The webcam drop down appears to not be working.  This would be exactly the same issue that I was seeing with the  http://apprtc.appspot.com/ demo.  I can only get access to one webcam at a time on one computer.  I used to be able to get access to three webcams.
